# GenAI-Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning and generative AI projects I built as part of my learning journey. Each project targets a different concept in modern ML—from fine-tuning to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LangChain-based pipelines. These projects were developed purely for **practice and deep understanding**, not for production use.
